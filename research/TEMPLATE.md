# Research Template — Per Substance

For each substance, produce this structure:

## {Name RU} ({Name EN})

### Mechanism of Action
- Target receptors/pathways
- How it produces its effects at molecular level
- Key enzymes involved (aromatase, 5α-reductase, etc.)

### Key Clinical Studies
For each study:
- **Author et al., Year** (PMID: XXXXXXXX)
  - Design: [RCT/meta-analysis/cohort/etc], N=XX, duration
  - Key finding: [specific numbers/outcomes]
  - Relevance: [why this matters]

Minimum 2-3 studies per substance (more for well-studied ones like testosterone).
Only real PMIDs from PubMed. If unsure about PMID, note "PMID: verify" but still include the study details.

### Bloodwork Markers to Monitor
For each marker:
- **Marker name** — frequency (e.g., every 3 months), why (what it catches)
- Flag thresholds if known

### Drug Interactions
- Substance + [interacting drug] → [effect/risk]
- Include both synergistic and dangerous combos

### Contraindications
- Absolute (never use if...)
- Relative (caution if...)

### Practical Notes
- Common stacking partners
- PCT requirements (if applicable)
- Typical cycle length
- Special administration notes

## Output Format
- One markdown file per category (e.g., `aas-research.md`, `peptides-research.md`)
- Real data only — no guessing, no fabricated PMIDs
- If data is sparse (e.g., newer SARMs), note "Limited human data" explicitly
- Russian language for descriptions, English for study citations
